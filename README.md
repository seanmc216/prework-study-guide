# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I have created a project called Prework Study Guide, the URL is: This website can be used as a guide through the Front-End Web Development Trilogy Education Services bootcamp. It has been designed as a place to record useful notes from the bootcamp. Through building this website I have begun my journey learning Front-End website development fundamentals.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
